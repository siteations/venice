				'Within fifteen years of the publication of Gutenberg’s Bible in Mainz, Germany, printers began to spread out across Europe. By the 1460s, print shops had been set up in Venice, all run by craftsmen who had immigrated there in search of work. While these printers were no doubt drawn to the intellectual community of scholars and teachers in Venice, they also would have been attracted to its cosmopolitanism. Venice incorporated residential communities from many cultures, as well as travelers and merchants who regularly visited the city.',
				'Paragraph on larger cosmopolitan context.',
				'By the mid-16th century, Venice was the powerhouse of printing in Europe. Printers produced all kinds of books, from large, elaborate folios to small, portable books meant for personal study. They also produced a wide variety of ephemera -- inexpensive single sheets that provided news or entertainment and were not intended to be saved. Some booksellers maintained upscale shops while others peddled their wares from a stall or simply stood on Rialto Bridge calling out to potential customers. Essentially, books, and their makers and sellers, were as varied as the inhabitants of and travelers to Venice.',
				'The material included here is not a complete survey of the Venetian book trade or religious communities of the period, but works to provide a glimpse of how printers, publishers, and booksellers shaped – and were shaped by – religious, political, intellectual, and social life in Venice.'
